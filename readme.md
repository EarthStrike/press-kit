# Earth Strike Materials Kit

This is our supplementary storage space for all Earth Strike graphical materials. Eventually, the contents of this respository will be migrated to, and synchronized with, the Materials page of the website (https://earth-strike.com/materials).

## Contents

Materials here are sorted into three categories:

### General
The go-to resources for advertising Earth Strike's essential message. If you're looking to spread materials such as posters, fliers, brochures, and stickers, then start here.

### Supplementary
Posters and images that have a different, unique hook, or address specific causes, messages, or events that are not central to our movement.

### Toolkit
Essential tools for use in creating new materials, including our logo, fonts, colours, and styleguide.

Each separate material is given its own folder, which contains the document in both publishable (.pdf or .png) and editable (.svg or .psd) formats, along with useful alternate versions of the document (black and white, etc.) where applicable.

## Submissions

For the moment, materials should be submitted in the #media-submissions channel on our international Discord server, **in a .zip folder that contains both the publishable and editable versions.** To clarify, this means you must include either an .svg or .psd file, so that your document can be modified and translated.

All materials must conform to the Earth Strike Styleguide, located in the /toolkit/styleguide folder. Submitting an editable version will allow members of the graphics team to modify your document in accordance with this styleguide if necessary.

If necessary, you can save the graphics team some work and include modified versions of your document such as:

- Printer-Friendly: a version of a printable document that is tailored for home printing, where printer ink costs and printing quality are concerns. Background images and colours over large areas should be removed, replacing them with white or light gray (#cccccc) depending on context, and inner text colours should be adjusted accordingly.

  If your submission merits a printer-friendly version, append "-pf" to its filename, and include it in both publishable and editable format.

- Grayscale: a version of a printable document that is tailored to black-and-white printing - especially for retail printing purposes where BW printing is MUCH cheaper than colour. In general, black and white should be used as much as possible, and brand colours such as our signature green should be replaced with blacks, whites, or grays, depending on context.

  Append the suffix "-bw" to the filename of the grayscale version, and include it in both publishable and editable format.

If you'd like, you can also include an info.txt file with your submission, that contains information about who created it and when.
